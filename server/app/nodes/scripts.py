I had the opportunity to work with Joao at jungle.ai, and his commitment and dedication to the company's mission were admirable. From day one, he demonstrated a strong passion and drive to achieve our shared goals.
One aspect of Joao that I found particularly impressive was his ability to quickly understand new information and ideas. No matter how high the learning curve was, he took it in stride and applied his newly acquired knowledge effectively. This talent for fast learning made him a highly valuable member of the team.
Additionally, Joao demonstrated excellent coping skills in the face of uncertainty. Whenever there were sudden changes or unexpected obstacles, he remained unfazed and focused on the task at hand. 
Overall, Joao is a dedicated, fast-learning, and resilient professional. I have no doubt that these qualities will continue to make him a strong asset to any team he joins in the future. I look forward to seeing all the great things he will undoubtedly accomplish in his career.
