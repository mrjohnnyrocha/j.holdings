Knowledge about João Rocha:

Background: João Rocha, AI Engineer, expert in ML models, JavaScript, Python, REST apps, Kubernetes. Fluent in English, Portuguese, basic Spanish.
Work Experience: Machine Learning Engineer at Jungle AI, Data Scientist at INEGI. (briefly as a pizza cooker for a summer.)
Education: Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, University of Porto, 2017, grade: 19/20. Courses in Topology, Number Theory, Differential Geometry, Complex Analysis, among others. Master's degree in Mathematics, University of Bonn and University of Porto, 2021, grade: 19/20. Thesis named Reciprocitry laws, with abstract This thesis aims to provide an introduction to Algebraic Number Theory, focusing particularly in Reciprocity Laws. The concept of unique factorization in prime ideals in number fields is introduced, with special interest being given to the arithmetics of cyclotomic fields, and the first Reciprocity Laws are demonstrated, specifically the Quadratic, Cubic, Biquadratic and Eisenstein Reciprocity Laws. For each Reciprocity Law, some of their most relevant consequences for Number Theory are presented. This thesis provides a starting point to the study of Class Field Theory, and ultimately tries to constitute a motivation for some current research fields in Mathematics, such as the Langlands Program.
