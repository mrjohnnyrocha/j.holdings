## Usage

Instructions on how to use your project and any relevant examples. Use `.env` and `nginx` files for deploying the frontend server, and also the backend if necessary. 

To deploy the frontend server using `.env` file, follow these steps:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. For example:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3017
    ```
3. Build the frontend application by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
4. Configure your nginx server to serve the built files. Here's an example nginx configuration:
    ```
    server {
         listen 3017;
         server_name your-domain.com;

         location / {
              root /<path-to-your-local-frontend>/build;
              index index.html;
              try_files $uri /index.html;
         }
    }
    ```
5. Start your nginx server to serve the frontend application.

To deploy the backend server using `.env` file, follow these steps:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file. For example:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database
    ```
3. Start the backend server using the following command:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --port 8000 --reload
    ```

Make sure to replace the example values with your actual configuration. These steps will help you deploy both the frontend and backend servers using `.env` and `nginx` files.
